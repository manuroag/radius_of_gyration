# Radius of gyration for alpha-helix and beta-sheet proteins

Calculate the scalling factor and radius of gyration for alpha-helix and beta-sheet proteins.

You will find two notebooks (one for alpha-helix and another for beta-sheet proteins), and two folders inside data containing PDB files of proteins belonging to each type.
